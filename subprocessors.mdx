# Gather subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Backpack. We establish GDPR-compliant data processing agreements with each subprocessor, extending GDPR safeguards everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use. These subprocessors are all located in the United States:

- [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/gdpr). Cloud services provider.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy). Cloud services provider.
- [Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/03/14/gdpr-sentry-and-you). Error reporting software.
- [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/amplitude-security-and-privacy/privacy). Analytics.
